## Note ‚úçüèª

### Reason you should not change State directly

- Changing object directly causes unexpected error, so that
  the object already exists should be immutable
- setState is asynchronous
- PureComponent do a shallow comparison

### Refactor the code for the testing

  - Bring the business logic to the class HabitPresenter
