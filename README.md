# Habit Tracker

It tracks your habit!

## features

Users are able to

- add new habit
- delete a habit
- see the list of habits
- see & control the frequency of habit

## 💡 What I learn

- create react-app
- JSX
- Class Component
- Function Component
- Lifecycle methods
- React Hook
- Pure Component
- memo(Higher Order Component)
- synthetic event
- state & Props
- Refs
- setState
- useEffect

### ✍🏻 Reason you should not change State directly

- Changing object directly causes unexpected error, so that
  the object already exists should be immutable
- setState is asynchronous
- PureComponent do a shallow comparison
